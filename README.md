## Abstract
**Aza Man** is a Multi-Agent AI system developed for the **[Agentic AI Developer Certification Program 2025](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/HrJ0xWtLzLNt)**, offered by **ReadyTensor**. Built with a [supervisor architecture (tool-calling)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/#multi-agent-architectures), it empowers users with personalized financial management. Aza Man leverages **LangGraph** for workflow orchestration and **SQLite** for state persistence, enabling a conversational assistant that sets budgets, tracks expenses, and manages savings goals with autonomy and context-awareness. It integrates cost-efficient SOTA language models via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), [Groq](https://console.groq.com/), and [TogetherAI](https://api.together.xyz/), with a **Streamlit** interface for seamless interaction. Aza Man promotes financial literacy and empowerment through intelligent automation, showcasing scalable AI agent design.

## 1. Introduction
Agentic AI systems enable autonomous, goal-driven interactions, moving beyond traditional chatbots. Aza Man addresses the need for accessible financial tools, particularly in regions like Nigeria, where economic challenges demand personalized budgeting solutions. By combining **LangGraph** for conversational workflows, **SQLite** for state management, and tool-calling capabilities, Aza Man delivers a robust, scalable financial assistant.

This publication details Aza Manâ€™s architecture, functionality, evaluation, deployment, and testing, highlighting its impact as a portfolio project for the certification program.

## 2. System Architecture
Aza Man features a modular, extensible multi-agent architecture:
- **Conversational Workflow**: LangGraph orchestrates multi-step reasoning and tool invocation, routing user inputs to appropriate tools and maintaining conversation state.
- **State Persistence**: A custom SQLite checkpointer stores user data for context-aware interactions across sessions.
- **Tool Integration**: Tools are bound to SOTA models via LangChainâ€™s `.bind_tools`.
- **Frontend**: A Streamlit interface provides an interactive dashboard for financial tracking.
- **LLM Integration**: Supports models from Groq, OpenRouter, and TogetherAI for cost-efficient performance.

## 3. Functionality
Aza Man offers:
- **Budget Creation**: Set income, savings goals, and expense budgets.
- **Expense Tracking**: Log expenses.
- **Savings Management**: Track savings progress.
- **Username Setting**: Personalize interactions.
- **Math Calculations**: Perform financial calculations.

Tools are integrated with plans to adopt the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/mcp/#use-mcp-tools) for standardized tool integration in future updates.

## 4. Evaluation
Aza Man was evaluated with a comprehensive test suite:
- **Test Suite**: 38 unit tests across `test_app.py` (6), `test_configuration.py` (5), `test_graph.py` (7), `test_prompts.py` (2), `test_state.py` (3), and `test_tools.py` (15).
- **Coverage**: 79% overall (267 statements, 56 missed), 66% for `graph.py` (102 statements, 35 missed).
- **Results**: 38/38 tests pass.
- **Test Cases**: Cover LLM invocation, tool execution, routing, summarization, and error handling (LLM failures, JSON errors, invalid tools, empty inputs, inappropriate content).
- **Coverage Gaps**: The 66% coverage for `graph.py` indicates untested branches in `call_model` and `summarize_conversation`. Future tests will target these areas to reach ~80% coverage.

## 5. Challenges and Lessons Learned
- **Streamlit & Async Events**: Streamlit struggles with async endpoints. Synchronous calls were used, but Gradio may be explored for async support.
- **LangChain MCP Adapters**: `AsyncSQLiteSaver` failed to update state variables beyond `messages`, leading to reliance on synchronous `SqliteSaver`.
- **Pydantic Validation**: Precise mocking of Pydantic-based tools was necessary to handle validation errors in tests.

## 6. Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Blaqadonis/azaman.git
   cd azaman
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n azaman python=3.11
   conda activate azaman  # Windows/Linux/Mac
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Create `data` Directory** (for logs, metadata, and SQLite database):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data
   ```
5. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   Add the following (replace with your API keys):
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key
   LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=false
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=Aza Man_FOR_AAIDC2025
   ```
6. **Configure Line Endings**:
   The repository includes a `.gitattributes` file to ensure consistent line endings.
7. **Update `project_config.py`**:
   Edit `project_config.py` to set `model`, `evaluator`, and `provider` (e.g., `groq`, `together`, `openrouter`):
   ```python
   PROJECT_CONFIG = {
       "project_name": "Aza Man",
       "page_icon": "images/azaman2.png",
       "backstory": (

       }
   }
   ```

## 7. Deployment
- **Local** (Access UI at [http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/)):
  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
- **Render**:
  Live at [Azaman on Render](https://azaman.onrender.com/).
- **Streamlit Cloud**:
  Live at [Azaman on Streamlit](https://azaman-aaidc2025.streamlit.app/).

### Troubleshooting
- **API Key Errors**: Ensure `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or `TOGETHER_API_KEY` is set in `.env`. Obtain keys from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), or [TogetherAI](https://api.together.xyz/).
- **SQLite Database Issues**: Verify the `data` directory exists and is writable. Run `mkdir -p data` if missing.
- **Streamlit Failure**: Ensure `requirements.txt` dependencies are installed. Run `pip install streamlit` if errors occur.
- **Test Failures**: Run `pytest --cov=src tests/` to check for regressions. Update tests for Pydantic validation errors if needed.
- **Line-Ending Warnings**: The `.gitattributes` file ensures consistent LF endings for Python files. Run `git add --renormalize .` if warnings persist.

## 8. Testing
Run tests with coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=src tests/ --cov-report=html
```
Output: 38/38 tests pass, 79% coverage. HTML report available in `htmlcov/`.

## 9. Future Work
To enhance Aza Man, future iterations could include:
- **Feature Expansion**: Add tools for currency conversion, investment tracking, or debt management.
- **Multi-User Support**: Scale the SQLite database for concurrent users, leveraging Kubernetes for deployment.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Integrate image processing (e.g., scanning receipts) using models like GPT-4o.
- **Better Guardrails**: Add safety checks for erroneous calculations and data leaks, with dedicated tests.
- **Resilience**: Implement retry with exponential backoff and timeout handling for LLM calls.
- **MCP**: Standardize all tool integration via Model Context Protocol.

## Conclusion
Aza Man, developed for **AAIDC 2025**, showcases the potential of AI agents to transform personal finance. It paves the way for future innovations in financial automation, aligning with the certification programâ€™s mission to train developers in cutting-edge AI technologies.
