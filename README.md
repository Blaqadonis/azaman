## Abstract
**Aza Man** is a Multi-Agent AI system developed for **[Agentic AI Developer Certification Program 2025](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/HrJ0xWtLzLNt)**, offered by **ReadyTensor**. Built with a [supervisor architecture (tool-calling)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/#multi-agent-architectures), it empowers users with personalized financial management. Aza Man leverages **LangGraph** for workflow orchestration and **SQLite** for state persistence, enabling a conversational assistant that sets budgets, tracks expenses, and manages savings goals with autonomy and context-awareness. It integrates cost-efficient SOTA language models via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), [Groq](https://console.groq.com/), and [TogetherAI](https://api.together.xyz/), with a **Streamlit** interface for seamless interaction. Aza Man promotes financial literacy and empowerment through intelligent automation, showcasing scalable AI agent design.

## 1. Introduction
Agentic AI systems enable autonomous, goal-driven interactions, moving beyond traditional chatbots. Aza Man addresses the need for accessible financial tools, particularly in regions like Nigeria, where economic challenges demand personalized budgeting solutions. By combining **LangGraph** for conversational workflows, **SQLite** for state management, and tool-calling capabilities, Aza Man delivers a robust, scalable financial assistant.

This publication details Aza Manâ€™s architecture, functionality, evaluation, deployment, and testing, highlighting its impact as a portfolio project for the certification program.

## 2. System Architecture
Aza Man features a modular, extensible multi-agent architecture:
- **Conversational Workflow**: LangGraph orchestrates multi-step reasoning and tool invocation, routing user inputs to appropriate tools and maintaining conversation state.
- **State Persistence**: A custom SQLite checkpointer stores user data for context-aware interactions across sessions.
- **Tool Integration**: Tools are bound to SOTA models via LangChainâ€™s ```.bind_tools````.
- **Frontend**: A Streamlit interface provides an interactive dashboard for financial tracking.
- **LLM Integration**: Supports models from Groq, OpenRouter, and TogetherAI for cost-efficient performance.

## 3. Functionality
Aza Man offers:
- **Budget Creation**: Set income, savings goals, and expense budgets.
- **Expense Tracking**: Log expenses.
- **Savings Management**: Track savings progress.
- **Username Setting**: Personalize interactions.
- **Math Calculations**: Perform financial calculations.

Tools are integrated with plans to adopt the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/mcp/#use-mcp-tools) for standardized tool integration in future updates.

## 4. Evaluation
Aza Man was evaluated with a comprehensive test suite:
- **Test Suite**: 40 unit tests across `test_app.py` (6), `test_configuration.py` (5), `test_graph.py` (12), `test_prompts.py` (2), `test_state.py` (3), and `test_tools.py` (11).
- **Coverage**: 80% overall (287 statements, 56 missed), 73% for `graph.py` (143 statements, 39 missed).
- **Results**: 39/40 tests pass. The failing test (`test_store_memory_tool_failure`) is due to a Pydantic validation mismatch but does not impact core functionality.
- **Test Cases**: Cover LLM invocation, tool execution, routing, summarization, and error handling (LLM failures, JSON errors, invalid tools, empty inputs, inappropriate content).

## 5. Challenges and Lessons Learned
- **Streamlit & Async Events**: Streamlit struggles with async endpoints. Synchronous calls were used, but Gradio may be explored for async support.
- **LangChain MCP Adapters**: ```AsyncSQLiteSaver``` failed to update state variables beyond ```messages```, leading to reliance on synchronous `SqliteSaver`.
- **Pydantic Validation**: The failing test highlights the need for precise mocking of Pydantic-based tools to avoid validation errors.

## 6. Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/blaqadonis/azaman.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv azaman
   source azaman/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   azaman\Scripts\activate  # Windows
3. Install dependencies (You need to have a CONDA environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt .
4. Create ```data``` directory (datapath for logs, metadata, and database):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data
5. Next, create a ```.env``` file:
   ```bash
    GROQ_API_KEY=...
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
    TOGETHER_API_KEY=...
    
    LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=false # Optional - for tracing.
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=...
    LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=Aza Man_FOR_AAIDC2025
6. Update ```project_config.py``` ( Update ```model```, ```evaluator```, and ```provider - groq, together, or openrouter```):
   ```bash
    PROJECT_CONFIG = {
      "project_name": "Aza Man",
